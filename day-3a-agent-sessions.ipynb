    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and impactful areas where AI is making significant strides. Here are some of the key new developments and ongoing trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a huge area of focus. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and more recently, transformer-based models) are being used to *design entirely new molecules* from scratch. These models can be trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties, allowing them to generate novel structures with specific desired characteristics (e.g., binding affinity to a target, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, low toxicity).\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Existing Leads:** Generative AI isn't just for starting from scratch. It can also take a promising but imperfect lead compound and suggest modifications to improve its efficacy, reduce side effects, or enhance its delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Uncovering Novel Targets:** AI algorithms are analyzing complex biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify previously unknown disease targets. This involves finding the specific proteins, genes, or pathways that are most critical for disease progression and can be modulated by a drug.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can help assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning if it's feasible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerating Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Predicting Compound Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models can predict how well a potential drug will work and its likelihood of causing adverse effects much earlier in the process, saving time and resources by deprioritizing compounds with poor prospects.\n",
      "*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that indicate whether a patient is likely to respond to a specific drug, which is crucial for personalized medicine and for designing more efficient clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Patient Stratification for Trials:** AI can help select the most appropriate patient populations for clinical trials, increasing the chances of success and reducing trial duration.\n",
      "*   **Analyzing Real-World Evidence (RWE):** AI can process RWE from electronic health records, insurance claims, and wearables to understand drug performance in real-world settings, informing future drug development and post-market surveillance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Advancements in Specific AI Techniques:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** These are particularly well-suited for molecular data, as molecules can be represented as graphs. GNNs are showing promise in predicting molecular properties and interactions.\n",
      "*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL is being explored for optimizing molecular design by rewarding AI agents for generating molecules with desired properties.\n",
      "*   **Large Language Models (LLMs) in Drug Discovery:** While often associated with text, LLMs are also being adapted to understand and generate chemical structures, analyze scientific literature for insights, and even assist in writing research papers and regulatory documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Focus on Underserved Areas:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rare Diseases:** AI is particularly valuable for rare diseases where patient populations are small, making traditional research methods challenging. AI can help identify patterns and potential treatments from limited data.\n",
      "*   **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** Developing new antibiotics is a critical need. AI is being used to discover novel antimicrobial compounds and to predict mechanisms of resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Recent Progress You Might See in the News:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Startups achieving milestones:** You'll see headlines about AI drug discovery companies like Atomwise, Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and others announcing successful pre-clinical results, partnerships with big pharma, or achieving specific drug development milestones.\n",

      "*   **New platform launches:** Companies are launching new AI platforms designed to accelerate specific stages of the drug discovery pipeline.\n",
      "*   **AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials:** The ultimate validation is when AI-designed or AI-assisted drugs actually start being tested in humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI is transforming drug discovery from a largely empirical, trial-and-error process into a more data-driven, predictive, and efficient endeavor. It's not about replacing scientists, but rather about augmenting their capabilities with powerful computational tools.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned in my previous response, which was:\n",
      "\n",
      "**AI for Target Identification and Validation**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a critical bottleneck in drug discovery. Finding the right target – the specific molecule or pathway in the body that a drug should interact with to treat a disease – is often the first major hurdle. If you choose the wrong target, even the best drug molecule will be ineffective or even harmful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this area:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Complexity of Biology:** The human body is incredibly complex. Diseases often involve intricate networks of genes, proteins, and cellular processes. Identifying the \"master switch\" or the most effective point of intervention is incredibly difficult.\n",
      "*   **Vast Amounts of Data:** Modern biology generates enormous datasets:\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences and variations.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics:** Which genes are being expressed (turned on) and at what levels.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** The types and amounts of proteins present.\n",
      "    *   **Metabolomics:** The small molecules involved in metabolism.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Data:** Patient health records, symptoms, treatment responses.\n",
      "    *   **Literature:** Millions of scientific papers describing biological experiments and findings.\n",
      "*   **Human Limitations:** It's impossible for a human researcher, or even a team of researchers, to sift through and synthesize all this data to find subtle, but critical, connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Helping:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI excels at pattern recognition, correlation finding, and hypothesis generation from massive, heterogeneous datasets. Here's how it's applied:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Integration and Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   AI platforms can integrate and normalize data from disparate sources (e.g., patient genomic data, cell line expression data, published research).\n",
      "    *   Machine learning algorithms can then analyze these integrated datasets to identify subtle correlations that might indicate a gene or protein's involvement in a disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identifying Novel Disease Pathways:**\n",
      "    *   **Network Biology:** AI can map out complex biological networks. By observing how these networks are disrupted in disease states compared to healthy states, AI can pinpoint key nodes (genes/proteins) that, if targeted, could restore normal function.\n",
      "    *   **Cause and Effect:** While correlation doesn't equal causation, advanced AI techniques can help infer causal relationships, suggesting which factors are likely driving the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n",
      "    *   Once a potential target is identified, the next question is: can we actually design a drug to interact with it? AI can analyze the structure and properties of the target protein to predict:\n",
      "        *   **Binding Pockets:** Are there specific sites on the protein where a drug molecule could attach?\n",
      "        *   **Accessibility:** Is the target protein located in a part of the cell or body that a drug can reach?\n",
      "        *   **Essentiality:** Is the target essential for disease progression, or is it something that can be inhibited without causing severe harm to the patient?\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Hypothesis Generation and Prioritization:**\n",
      "    *   AI can generate a large number of potential targets and then rank them based on various criteria: strength of evidence, predicted druggability, novelty, and potential therapeutic impact. This allows researchers to focus their experimental validation efforts on the most promising candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Leveraging Unstructured Data (Text Mining):**\n",
      "    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of AI, can \"read\" and understand scientific literature. NLP models can extract relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs that might not be explicitly stated in a way a human would easily find. This can uncover hidden connections and suggest new targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of AI in Action for Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cancer Research:** AI is being used to identify specific genetic mutations or protein expressions that drive particular types of cancer, suggesting targeted therapies.\n",
      "*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** Analyzing genetic predispositions and cellular dysfunction in diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's to find new targets for intervention.\n",
      "*   **Infectious Diseases:** Identifying essential proteins or pathways in pathogens that can be targeted to develop new antivirals or antibacterials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, AI for target identification and validation is about using computational power to:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Make sense of overwhelming biological data.**\n",
      "*   **Uncover hidden connections and disease mechanisms.**\n",
      "*   **Identify the most promising molecular targets for drug development.**\n",
      "*   **Increase the probability of success in the early stages of drug discovery.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This development is crucial because it directly addresses the \"starting point\" problem in drug discovery, ensuring that the immense effort and investment that follows are directed towards the most scientifically sound and therapeutically relevant opportunities.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n"
