    "Each Gemini model on Google AI Studio has a dedicated per-minute quota. You can find the details for each model on the [Pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits). When you exceed this limit within a 60-second window, you may see a `ResourceExhausted` error.\n",

You will also need to set `export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE` in your code before running your agent.

Note that using Vertex AI with billing enabled means that calls to Gemini will be billed. Note that billing is not required for this course, but if you wish to use higher quota, this is one way of doing so.
